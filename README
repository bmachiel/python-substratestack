substratestack
==============

Introduction
------------

substratestack is a Python module that helps simplifying substrate stackups
for use in Momentum and Sonnet. It was initially written for use in an MMIC
design methodology, but it might also be useful for PCB design.

The design of MMIC passives such as planar inductors and transmission lines
requires simulations using electromagnetic solvers, for instance ADS Momentum
or Sonnet em. These require an accurate definition of the substrate stack in
order to output correct models. The user typically copies the substrate stack
definition from the documentation provided by the IC foundry into the solver
by means of its GUI. Often the stack needs to be simplified to keep simulation
times down. The simplification and manual entry of the stack is a tedious and
error-prone processes. substratestack tries to make this process quicker and
less error-prone.

substratestack takes the detailed definition of a substrate stackup describing
the oxide layers and metals of an IC or PCB technology. Optionally, metals
select can be removed from the stack to reduce simulation times. substratestack
can then merge oxide layers, automatically taking care of calculating the
equivalent permittivity. It can also write out a visualization of the stack, 
before and after oxide merging, so the correctness can be verified.

Finally, the simplified stack definition can be exported to a Momentum slm file
or a Sonnet project for direct inclusion in these solvers.
